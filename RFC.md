# RFC: Ideas beyond the test assignment

- Authentication system (better-auth)
- AI guessing functionality. Adding a magical button to guess the right price direction (openai sdk / mastra)
- Players scores stats (on a different route via tanstack router and table)
- BTC pricing graph (Recharts)

Small potential enhancements are documented in the code via TODO comments.
